## About

This repository contains my solutions for the **minitalk** project in 42.

**The minitalk project** is a 42 project that focuses on implementing inter-process communication using POSIX signals. It involves creating a server that can receive and display messages, and a client that encodes and sends messages to the server. The project highlights concepts such as signal handling, process management, and binary data transmission, while ensuring robust error handling and communication reliability.
